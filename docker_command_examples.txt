HOW TO: INSTALL THIS WITH DOCKER

1- Build it:
•	Create a new directory and place the Dockerfile inside the directory that you just created
•	Run the following command from the directory that hold the Dockerfile
•	you can replace dashboard:latest to another tag and value(version)
#docker build –t dashboard:latest .

2- Run it:
- In order to run and use the dashboard you need to perform port mapping between your external available port to the expose port inside the dockerfile (which is 80 in our dockerfile case)
# docker run –dti -p 8080:80 dashboard:latest

3- Use it:
Browse to 127.0.0.1:8080

That's all !
